Drift is an open-source library for Flutter that provides a lightweight, yet powerful local database solution. 
It is inspired by SQLite and aims to simplify local data management in Flutter apps.
Drift abstracts the complexity of database operations, making it easier for developers to perform CRUD operations on local data. 
Whether youâ€™re building an offline-capable app or need to cache user data locally, Drift has you covered with its easy-to-use API.


What is local database?
    Local databases reside on your local drive or on a local area network.

What is Migration?
